## Contributing

## Developing

Clone this repository, install the dependencies and simply run `grunt develop`.

```
$ npm install -g grunt-cli bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ grunt develop
```

At this point, the source was validated, tested and built into the `build/` directory. A simple webserver is launched so
that you can browse the generated code, documentation and the code coverage. If you now edit and save any project file,
the necessary `grunt` tasks will be triggered to update the build and docs.

```

More info on the (Grunt based) tools can be found in the
[boilerplate documentation](http://jarvis.cork-labs.org/boilerplate-nglib/current/docs).
